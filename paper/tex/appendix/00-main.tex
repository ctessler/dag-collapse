\section{Strictly Increasing Discrete Concave WCET Functions}

\revise{This section must be re-written, since it is taken verbatim
  from the other paper that C.T. is working on.}

For tasks that benefit from \texttt{BUNDLE}-based scheduling and
analysis, ${c_i(m)}$ is a strictly increasing discrete concave
function. Tasks that do not are made vacuously concave by restricting
jobs to release one thread, and discussed further in
Section~\ref{sec:bundle-growth}. 

A consequence of ${c_i(m)}$'s strictly increasing discrete
concavity is a limit on the increase of the WCET as the number of
threads increases. This property is referred to as the
\emph{non-increasing growth} of ${c_i(m)}$ and is leveraged in
Sections~\ref{sec:schedulability} and \ref{sec:eval}.

\begin{definition}[Concavity Restriction on WCET Growth]
  \label{prop:ni-growth}
  For a strictly increasing discrete
  concave WCET function ${c_i(m)}$:
  \label{prop:wcet-growth}
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:wcet-growth}
    \indent
    \forall m \in \mathbb{N}^+~|~c_i(m) - c_i(m - 1) \ge c_i(m + 1) - c_i(m)
  \end{equation}
  It then follows for ${m_x \ge m_y > 0}$
  \begin{align*}
    \indent
    c_i(m_x + 1) - c_i(m_x) &\le c_i(m_x) - c_i(m_x - 1) \\
    &\le c_i(m_x - 1) - c_i(m_x - 2) \\
    &... \\
    &\le c_i(m_y) - c_i(m_y + 1) \\
    &\le c(m_y) - c(m_y - 1)
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}


A WCET function ${c_i(m)}$ that obeys Property~\ref{prop:wcet-growth},
will produce a value for ${c_i(m+1)}$ threads which is greater than
${c_i(m)}$. The difference between ${c_i(m+1)}$ and ${c_i(m)}$ must be less
than or equal to the difference of ${c_i(m)}$ and ${c_i(m-1)}$. As the
number of threads increase, ${c(m)}$ increases at a decreasing (or
stable) rate.
